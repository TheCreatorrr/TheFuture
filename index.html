    <h1>FmBLS</h1>

    <p>1. NoFap, No Porn, Semen Retention. 
This one is pretty self-explanatory, if NoFap is foreign to you I recommend the YouTubers – IceColdJT or VonTooCut. Most other YouTubers try to monetize NoFap so they don’t want you to succeed. Porn is bad for the brain, sure you won’t die from watching porn, but that shit is for average motherfuckers who want to stay the same forever. If you think you can stay disciplined while watching porn think again. That shit is just too powerful. Semen Retention is a mindset. Tell your wife, spouse, or girlfriend no sex for 90 days because you simply will not have the time. Wet dreams are obviously an exception, and women can do this shit too. No masturbation is not easy, but it is the number one most fundamental pillar of FmBLS.

2. Learn another language.
Maybe you only speak one language, maybe you speak two, maybe you speak eight. It doesn’t matter, learn another one. Language is the key to expanding your connections and more connections means more opportunities. There is a degree of luck in all successful people’s pasts, but luck can be maximized with more opportunities. Plus, learning a language allows you to think differently in that language. If you do not know how to learn a language then research it. Expand your opportunities, work daily to speak another language.

3. Play an instrument
Playing an instrument is a great joy when mastered and a great tool to increase cognitive function. Why do you think all the band kids got Straight A’s in high school? If you do not know how to play any instruments, pick an instrument and learn. Daily practice will turn the beginners to masters and masters to artists.

4. Journal and Meditate
The first and last things you do every day should be to journal and meditate. Wake up and pull out the journal to see what comes to your mind first thing in the morning. Meditate to set your mind right for the day. Before bed, pull out the journal and write down how your day went, where you succeeded or where you failed. Meditate at least five minutes to ensure the quickest time from laying in bed to falling asleep.

5. Eat every meal outside
You do not spend enough time outside. How do you expect to meet people and increase your connections in your room where nobody else will ever come. It’s fucking obvious. Work and school do prevent many from being outside most of the day, so set a simple goal of eating every meal outside. Sunshine, fresh air, and seeing real people are essentials for the brain to function properly.

6. Exercise daily
There are no requirements for the amount or intensity of the exercise, simply this: every day you go a little bit harder than yesterday. If you ran a mile yesterday, then run a mile and do ten sit-ups today. In the gym, use progressive overload to build more muscle. This challenge does not require any 4:00 AM wake ups to do cardio, or three hour lifts in the gym. If that’s your shit then go for it, but the challenge is simply to exercise daily and watch your body transform.

7. Plan your meals in advance
41.9% of Americans are OBESE. Not just a little overweight, but obese. Those numbers are as of 2021. It’s 2023 and I’m scared to know what new record has been broken. The irony is that people still starve on earth and people still starve in the USA. It’s not like there is a food shortage, Americans only threw away 60 MILLION tons of food last year. Maybe you aren’t one of these people, obese and wasteful. But maybe you are. The solution is simple: every night, plan your meals for tomorrow. Diet appropriately for how you want to look and feel. Never waste food. If you don’t finish your meal, then save it for tomorrow. True winners have nutrition dialed in so they can focus on their other tasks. 

8. Only take cold showers
A cold shower sets the day off right. Taking them two to three times a day, while may run your water bill up, sets the mind right. In addition, your muscles recover and your skin stays clear. Pretty simple, take them cold.

9. Study your interests
Fundamental to greatness is excellence within your field. So what is your field? It is the field that you love to be in and work that you think must be done for. Not to meet a deadline, but to change the world. Everyday you must study your field to become the best, and this should be fun. It is after all your interest. The more work you put into learning your interest the more successful you will be. Block out the time to study and get the motherfucker done. 

10. Read books
I know the feeling all too well, its late and you have the choice to reach for the book or the tv remote. Who the fuck would ever choose a book over YouTube or Netflix? You motherfucker. You want to know how and where to separate yourself from the average, right here. Every time you want to mindlessly stare at a screen, ask yourself how bad you want to be great. Fm and B are simply prerequisites to greatness, L is where you pull ahead of the crowd. 

11. Accomplish Work or Homework before the deadline
Pretty straightforward. If you want to have time to work on your goals and study your field, you better get the requirements done ASAP. Additionally, getting work done before deadlines shows your commitment to your employer or teacher. Procrastination is simply a mask for laziness, and there is no room for laziness on the path to greatness. Kobe Bryant lived by the motto “Rest at the end not in the middle” which you must take as a gospel truth. Get the work done, then rest.

12. Restate long term goals
David Goggins once said “life is the biggest endurance race”, which is completely true for those who wish to be great. You and me. We can’t win in one day and you can’t take a day off. When running a race, you don’t just stop for a minute to catch your breath. Not if you want to win that is. You keep the pace constant and push yourself to the end. Sometimes, however, in the constant hustle of life it is easy to forget why you started the race in the first place. The FmBLS challenge requires you to restate your goals every night. If they change, you won’t waste a single minute more on the wrong path. If you don’t know what your goals are, the answer comes in the repetitions. Through the daily struggle to push yourself further you will find your “reason why” and you will discover your “drive”. 

13. Respect Everyone
Now that you have agreed to the 90 Day challenge of FmBLS, let me share a nugget of wisdom with you. In life, if you want to be great, you must keep your enemies few and your friends many. Machiavelli wrote in his work The Prince, that the most important thing a prince must avoid is being hated by his people. For anyone who wants to be of any importance or greatness, you will have people who admire you and those who are suspicious of you. Some will see how you carry yourself and immediately dislike you. The way to keep the haters few is to respect everyone. You listen and take genuine interest in what they say to you in conversations. When the time comes to speak your mind, it is likely that your opinion will be contrary to theirs, but you must remain calm. Say nothing in the face of insults and filter your thoughts before they become words. Not only will you appear to be the better person, but your haters may even apologize or try to earn back your trust and become one of your admirers. Staying clam in front of haters makes you more approachable, as people have seen who you are in the heat of the moment. And being more approachable leads to more opportunities. Simply be Superman. 

Nobody said this would be easy, and FmBLS will not make you one of the greats immediately. But if you are wondering why you are still average, it’s time to step up life a bit.</p>
